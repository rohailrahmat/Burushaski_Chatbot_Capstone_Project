# Burushaski-to-English Chatbot

## Project Overview
The *Burushaski-to-English Chatbot* is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to bridge the communication gap for speakers of the Burushaski language. This chatbot is capable of translating conversations from Burushaski to English and vice versa, facilitating seamless interaction and preserving the richness of the Burushaski language.

## Features
- *Language Translation*: Translates text from Burushaski to English and English to Burushaski.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.
- *Machine Learning Powered*: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models to ensure accurate translations.
- *Scalability*: Can be expanded to include more languages in the future.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: 
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (for model training)
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - Flask (for backend API)
  - Streamlit/React (for frontend interface)
- *Data*: Annotated Burushaski-English datasets
- *Version Control*: Git and GitHub
